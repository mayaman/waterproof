She obviously looks amazing but Like do y’all focus on anything else other than ppl’s ages.","I love her but she is making so many mistakes!!!! Cleanser, mask then serums. Never put the applicator on the face directly!!! Also do your neck!  She is stunningly beautiful. I feel like there’s too much sit C, What are all the concentrations? I would react so bad!
